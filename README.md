Overview
The Registration Page allows users to create a new account for StreamHub. The page features form validation to ensure that all required fields are filled and that the entered data meets the required format (email and password length). The form includes fields for name, email, and password, with a Register button to submit the form.

Features
Form Validation: Ensures all fields are filled out correctly before submission.
